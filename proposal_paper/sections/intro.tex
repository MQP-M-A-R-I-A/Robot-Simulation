\section{Introduction}

We will plan the motion of a 5 DOF inchworm robot from a start to end node. As we progress in the project we plan on making the creation of the path more complex by either introducing more obstacles or adding more robots to the system. If we have time we will attempt to ferry blocks from one location to another.
