\section{Metrics for Evaluation of Success}
The projectâ€™s baseline success metric will be the successful path planning and traversal of an inchworm robot in a playground simulated in Gazebo. This will require a working path planning algorithm as well as a fully developed motion planning system.While the MQP this project is extending has done some gait work, it has yet to be implemented or tested on a real or simulated robot. We will create a path planning algorithm that can create an optimized path to a determined location. We have larger hopes to possibly get to a bigger picture with multiple robots maybe with collision detection but this is past our evaluation of success. Additionally, if time allows, we would like to test building a pyramid to compare our system to the previous MQP results. However, this will require us to achieve a significant portion of our reach goals, and will likely not be achieved in this project.
