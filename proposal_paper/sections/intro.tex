\section{Introduction}

In this project, we will plan the motion of a 5 DOF inchworm robot from a start to end node. As we progress in the project we plan on making the creation of the path more complex by either introducing more complexity with obstacles or possibly adding more moving robots to the system. We have taken inspiration and the overall model of the robot from a Major Qualifying Project. 

The Major Qualifying Project (MQP) is focusing on the smart blocks aspect of the project to develop the construction algorithm that creates the blueprint for the desired structure. In this project, we will develop the motion planning of inchworm robots that can path plan from a start location to a given destination. If we have time we will attempt to ferry blocks from one location to another. The smart blocks will take inspiration from the decentralized manner of stigmergic building by introducing intelligent building material with no centralized planner. By doing so, the blocks will be able to guide the inchworms with simple instructions to create complex structures. Additionally, this will mitigate the need for highly intelligent inchworms and instead delegate communication and construction planning among the building material (blocks). This allows for the inchworm robot to only concern itself with creating a path to place the block in the structure according to the block algorithm.
