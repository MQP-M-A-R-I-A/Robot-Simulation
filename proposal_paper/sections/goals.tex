\section{Goals}
We have created minimum, expected, and reach goals for our project. Our minimum goal is creating a fully setup simulation playground which includes a robot able to follow the gait. This simulation is necessary to test and complete the path and motion planning for our project. We will be able to visualize what the algorithm is doing and debug. The expected goals are creating a path for the robot and footstep planning for just the robot. We aim to visualize the path created and see the robot taking the path by the end of our project. The reach goals we have considered are moving with a block, creating a 3D walking gait, 3D path planning of going up walls, and implementing multiple robots into the system. These reach goals break into two distinct routes of expansion: introducing blocks or multiple robots. To introduce blocks, we will develop the gait for the inchworm to move with a block.Then, we will work on the 3D walking gait  for going up walls and traversing corners . With a complete gait, we can develop a 3D path planning algorithm which allows for multi-level structures.  To expand on the swarm route, we will add multiple robots to the system and work on collision detection.
