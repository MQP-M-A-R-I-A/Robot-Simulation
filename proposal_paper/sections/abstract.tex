    In this paper, we focus on developing the inchwormâ€™s path and motion algorithms. A path planning system will be developed to consider variables such as space and collision avoidance. To do this, several algorithms will be considered, such as A*, RRT*, or RAGS (Risk Averse Graph Section). To produce the inchworm motion, we look into various footstep planners and analyze the kinematics and dynamics to achieve a walking gait. These algorithms will be tested in our simulated environments within Gazebo and RVIZ.
