\section{Metrics for Evaluation of Success}
The projectâ€™s baseline success metric will be the successful path planning and traversal of an inchworm robot in a playground simulated in Gazebo. This will require a working path planning algorithm as well as a fully developed motion planning system. This project is focused on gait work and simulating the robot following the created path. We will create a path planning algorithm that can create an optimized path to a determined location. We have larger hopes to possibly get to a bigger picture with multiple robots maybe with collision detection but this is past our evaluation of success.
